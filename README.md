# :book: ngx-foldable

TODO: badges

> ngx-foldable is a set of components and services to help you build dual-screen experiences for foldable or dual-screen devices, such as the [Surface Duo](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/web/?WT.mc_id=ngxfoldable-github-yolasors)

TODO: gif demo

## Status

This is currently an experimental project aiming to explore how existing web apps could be adapted to build responsive UIs on dual-screen devices, with as little changes as possible on the code.

## How to test on your browser

The dual-screen emulation feature requires Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome canary versions for now, with experimental flags to enable.

Follow [the instructions here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/surface-duo/build-and-test-dual-screen-web-apps/?WT.mc_id=ngxfoldable-github-yolasors#build-and-test-on-the-desktop) to setup your browser for dual-screen emulation.

## Library usage

Add the library to your Angular project:

```sh
npm install ngx-foldable
```

Check out the [demo](./demo) project to see an example usage of the library.
